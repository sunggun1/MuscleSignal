# MuscleSignal

React Native muscle utilization rate App

My team used a ble communication from a arduino uno sensor.

We used react native app, aws ec2 with terraform, python flask.
My team wanted to use AI for linear pattern recognition.
But it was so hard to find and make new one. 
I found some github open source. but they weren't that good. 
I didn't know how to apply and change it for my code.
I only made whole software by myself. Time wasn't enough to make even AI.
this app is uploaded on appstore.
